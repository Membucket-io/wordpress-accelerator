# WordPress Accelerator by [Membucket.io](http://membucket.io)

Membucket.io is the first website accelerator capable of delivering the sub-second website. Membucket caches websites to the server's memory allowing for ultra-fast load times on a shared hosting platform and is also the first memory caching application that provides complete data security and isolation compatible with a shared, virtual private server, or cloud environment. Membucket is 100% memcache-protocol compatible and can be leveraged just as easily.

Here is how to get started with Membucket:

Step 1: Log into cPanel and navigate to the Membucket section choosing "Create Well".

If the Membucket section does not exist, contact your web host and have them install Membucket on the server.

Step 2: Select Wordpress in the Software drop down menu and choose "Create Wells". Add several buckets to the well(s) to create, the number of buckets you require is determined by the size of your website and the diversity of content.

Step 3: Download, install, and activate the Membucket WordPress plugin.
